# IPFS-Analytics-Competiton
This repository contains the Jupyter Notebooks that I used in the Data Analytics competition in the College of Business at Kansas State University, hosted by IPFS. The competition was to build a machine learning classifier to accurately predict if a borrower would cancel their premium finance loan, and to figure out which factors were most important in determining if they would cancel or not. There are 3 separate notebooks, one for data cleaning, one for visualization, and one for model building. My submission took 2nd place out of 32 teams from all across the university, and it won $3000.
